## General Information

Collaborations can be accessed directly here: [https://api.centralcoastclimate.org/dashboard/c4Backend/collaborations/](https://api.centralcoastclimate.org/dashboard/c4Backend/collaborations/)

To add an individual collaboration, all you need is the collaboration name.
If you wish, a description can also be added. For information on adding bulk
collaborations, please refer to [Importing Data](importing-data.md). No special
actions need to be performed to import collaborations.
