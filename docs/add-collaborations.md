## General Information

Collaborations can be accessed directly here: [https://api.centralcoastclimate.org/dashboard/c4Backend/collaborations/](https://api.centralcoastclimate.org/dashboard/c4Backend/collaborations/)

> **NOTE** When adding collaborations, you **must not** include commas in any
> of the fields. This will cause issues when importing/exporting in bulk.

To add an individual collaboration, all you need is the collaboration name.
If you wish, a description can also be added.

## Add Bulk

For information on using the bulk uploader, please reference
[how to import](importing-data.md). Explained below is some unique information
required to import collaborations.

When importing collaborations, the system requests the following information:

|ID|Collaboration Name|Collaboration Description|
|---|---|---|
|Do not include|Required|Optional|

When importing data, omit the `ID` row.

A template excel file for data entry can be found [here](assets/templates/CollaborationBlankTemplate.xlsx)
